This directory houses the English-Language Documentation

Written in the United States (originally), all documentation was created
first in English.  With the expansion of AOL's Instant Messenger service
to multiple server sites world-wide, and the potential for others to arise
using the "toc" on "sflap" protocols, this documentation really needs to
be flexible for multi-lingual support and participation.

Hence, on 10 May 2000, the entire project documentation was moved to this
doc/en/ subdirectory.  Additional pointer files were added in the root of
the project and in the new doc/ subdirectory to better explain this move.

"en" for English, is just ONE of the 136 language codes in ISO-639.
