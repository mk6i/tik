There is a new paths structure in TiK, implemented for maximum portability
across platforms. Please look at the new example.tikrc for changes which need
to be made to the media paths. In the future, no paths should be hardcoded,
but instead use the file join $::TIK(BASEDIR) structure. Changes may also be
needed in some of the packages (most notably the weather package).

Additionally, in the distribution, the documentation has captured its
own directory hierarchy.
