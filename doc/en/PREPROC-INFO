About

     Preproc (formerly TikTools) is a preprocessor for TiK instant messages 
     and chats.

Features

  1. Enables automatic conversion of URLs to links in the typed text.
  2. Provides IRC like commands to change your password, format your
     nickname etc.
  3. Provides methods of altering typed text.
  4. Allows for the quick execution of commands.
  5. Provides easy access to TiK features.

Configuration

     The following lines should have been already added to your ~/.tik/tikrc 
     file. If they have not, here they are, along with an explanation.

     # add next line to automatically ignore people on your deny list when
     they enter the chat room
     # or set 1 to zero to disable the option
     set ::TIK(options,autoignoredeny) 1

     # add this line and change appropriately to specify where your fortune
     program is located
     set ::TIK(options,fortuneprog) /pkg/local/bin/fortune

     # add this line after changing appropriately to specify where your
     webster program is located
     set ::TIK(options,websterprog) /pkg/local/bin/webster

Usage

     After you have followed the above procedure the following commands
     options will be available

        1. Most of the urls present in the text you type will be
           automatically converted to links. This include http links and
           mail address.

        2. You can set away mode by typing the following command in any
           IM or chat window and pressing enter

            /away text of the away message
		or
	    /away away_msg_nickname
         
            /brb will automatically spawn an away message that says 'brb'
		unless 'brb' is a nickname to another away message, in which
		case it will spawn said away message.

            typing /away by itself will remove the away message. This is
            equivalent to the /back command.

         3. You can unset the away mode by using the command

            /back

            /away without any following message also has the same effect.

         4. You can format your nickname by typing

            /nick newformattedname

            The usual length limits are enforced by the server itself.
            You can only insert spaces and change the case of the letters
            in your existing name.

         5. You can change your password by typing

            /password currentpassword newpassword

         6. You can type a url with an anchor of your choice by using the
            command

            /url url optional anchor text

            e.g. typing
            /url  http://www.lordzork.com LordZork Industries
            will create a link like this LordZork Industries.

         7. The commands /webster, /lookup, /dict, /word and /define are
            linked to the webster program to lookup the definition of a
            word if you configured the  ::TIK(options,websterprog)
            option specified above. so you can use

            /dict peace

            and it will send the definition of the word as a message.
            ###  Webster is only available for Nextstep. Prismatic and I
            ###  are working on an alternative. --daspek

         8. The words /fortune or /yow are linked to the fortune program
            if you configured the ::TIK(options,fortuneprog) option
            above. So typing

            /fortune

            will send a fortune cookie message to the chat or IM.

            You can also specify which fortune database you wish to use.
            For example, /fortune sports will return a sports fortune.
  
         9. Typing /bw or /rev followed by the message with send the
            message reversed.


            /bw message
            /rev message

            e.g. typing
            /rev Hello!
            will print !olleH in the chat room or IM.

        10. Typing /crazy, /lame or /eleet followed by a message will
            send the message in the lame script kiddie notation

             /lame message
            /crazy message
            /eleet message

            e.g. type /lame Yo! I am an eleet haxor
            will print Y0! 1 4M 4N 31337 H4X0R in the chat room or IM.

        11. Typing /rot13 followed by a message converts that message to
            rot13 encryption format and sends it to the chat room

            /rot13 text message

            e.g. typing
            /rot13 Hello
            will print Uryyb in the chat room.

            /rot13 is not limited to 13 only you can use any positive
            number within limits of Tcl. e.g. you can use /rot25 also.

        12. Typing /time anywhere in the message returns the current time.

        13. Typing /signoff signs off of AIM while still keeping TiK open.
  
        14. Typing /exit signs off and quits TiK.
	
	15. Typing /broadcast, /bcast, or /b<anything>cast, will broadcast a 
            message to the last number of people you talked to as specified, 
	    all the people  in a certain group, or all buddies.
	    syntax: /bcast all <msg>
                    /bcast <number> <msg>
	            /bcast <group> <msg> 
             ex.    /bcast all I'm going to get off now.
                    would send "I'm going to get off now." to every buddy
		    with whom you have an open IM window. However, 
                
                    /bcast 3 Turn my lights back off, guys. This is not funny.
	 	    would send "Turn my lights back off, guys. This is not
		    funny." to the last three people you've spoken with,
	            provided you have IM windows open with them.

		    /bcast Buddies I'm going now. Bye.
                    would send "I'm going now. Bye." to everyone online
                    in your 'Buddies' group, regardless of whether or not
		    you have an open conversation with them.
	
	16. Typing /day anywhere in the message returns the current day.

	17. Typing /date anywhere in the message returns the current date.

	18. Typing /exec command executes the command and sends its output
	    to the buddy.
	    syntax: /exec <command>
             ex.    /exec uptime
                    would send the output of the 'uptime' command (current
       		    uptime and load averages) to the buddy.
