As of TiK 0.82 we have replaced our old Logo of an AOL Instant
Messenger Running Man and an AOL Triangle with one that looks
nicer within TiK. As you can see, it still includes the AIM
Running Man. 

Let it be known that the Running Man is a service
mark of America Online, Inc. (AOL). TiK's roots lie within
AOL and its old AOL-supplied Logo contained AOL trademarks. It
is for this reason that we feel it is acceptable for us to use
the Running Man inside of TiK. This should be viewed as a
compliment to AOL, rewarding them for their hard work on the
TiK project and the TOC servers by stamping their name right
on the face of the product.

If for some reason AOL requests that we remove the Running
Man from our new logo we will promptly do so and probably
hold a mascot contest for a replacement. Let us hope that
does not need to happen. Enjoy the new logo and let us all
thank Brant Walsh (DewJazzOLP), the Photoshop <i>god</i> 
for doing such a great job with it.
