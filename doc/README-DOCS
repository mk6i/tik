The subdirectories here are named for ISO-639 Language codes.
Each may have a base for general documentation, and subdirectories
by type (e.g. roff, Windows Help, HTML, texinfo)  The files in the
base directory for each type are expected to be plain text in the
most customary characterset for the language.

E.g. in an ru/ subdirectory, text files would be expected to be in KOI8-R or 
     Windows Cyrillic (1250?), or duplicated in subdirs by those names, if
     both exist.

     in an en/ subdirectory, ASCII or ISO-Latin-1


To allow multi-lingual automatic selection of the documentation based
on browser preferece (for the html/ subdirectories), create a common
directory with server or filesystem symlinks, using a webserber which
supports automatic language selection.  For example with Apache's
"multi-views" feature:

	mkdir htdocs/tik
        ln -s htdocs/tik/en/ $tikhome/doc/en/
	ln -s $tikhome/doc/en/html/index.html htdocs/tik/index.html.en

  etc.

In this way, people who already have accurate language preferences set
in their browser will automatically get the available language, based
on their preferences (and server defaults).  For those who do NOT have
accurate preferences, they may still be able to select by language, from
links in a language selection page (not currently included).
